# Remote Home Assistant - Search Feature Enhancement

## Overview

This update introduces enhanced search functionality to the Remote Home Assistant configuration flow, making it easier to manage large Home Assistant instances with many entities and services.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Discovery Endpoint Registration (400 Bad Request Error)
- **Issue**: The discovery endpoint was only registered for remote instances, not main instances
- **Fix**: Moved the discovery view registration to `async_setup()` so it's available for all instances
- **File Modified**: `custom_components/remote_homeassistant/__init__.py`

### 2. Created Search Selector Module
- **New File**: `custom_components/remote_homeassistant/search_selector.py`
- **Features**:
  - Searchable multi-select components for entities, services, and domains
  - Domain-based grouping with item counts
  - Search across multiple fields (entity ID, name, domain, friendly name)
  - Visual organization with headers and indentation

### 3. Enhanced Config Flow UI
- **File Modified**: `custom_components/remote_homeassistant/config_flow.py`
- **Improvements**:
  - Replaced standard select dropdowns with searchable selectors
  - Added entity counts to domain selections
  - Improved organization of services by domain
  - Real-time search filtering

### 4. Frontend Search Component
- **New File**: `custom_components/remote_homeassistant/frontend/searchable-select.js`
- **Features**:
  - Custom web component for enhanced selection UI
  - Real-time search with highlighting
  - Checkbox-based selection
  - Bulk operations (Select All/Clear)
  - Visual feedback for selected items

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Long dropdown lists difficult to navigate
- No search capability
- Hard to find specific entities/services
- Poor performance with many items

### After
- Real-time search across all items
- Organized by domain with counts
- Checkbox selection for better visibility
- Bulk selection operations
- Improved performance with filtering

## Technical Details

### Search Algorithm
- Case-insensitive substring matching
- Searches across multiple fields:
  - Full entity/service ID
  - Name portion only
  - Domain
  - Friendly names (when available)

### UI Components
- Custom selector configurations using Home Assistant's selector framework
- Enhanced with search metadata for better filtering
- Maintains compatibility with existing Home Assistant UI

## Usage

1. **Searching**: Type in the search box to filter items in real-time
2. **Selection**: Click checkboxes or items to select/deselect
3. **Bulk Operations**: Use "Select All Visible" or "Clear Selection" buttons
4. **Navigation**: Items are grouped by domain for easier navigation

## Future Enhancements
