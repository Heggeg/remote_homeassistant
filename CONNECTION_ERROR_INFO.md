# Connection Refused Error - Separate Issue

## Error Details

You're getting a "Connection refused" error when trying to connect to 192.168.40.110:8123. This is a different issue from the config flow error.

## What This Means

```
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connect call failed ('192.168.40.110', 8123)
```

This error indicates that:
1. The remote Home Assistant instance at 192.168.40.110 is not accessible
2. Port 8123 might be blocked or the service isn't running
3. Or the IP address/port might be incorrect

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Remote HA is Running**
   - Check if Home Assistant is running on 192.168.40.110
   - Ensure it's listening on port 8123

2. **Test Connection**
   - Try accessing http://192.168.40.110:8123 in a web browser
   - From the main HA instance, try: `curl http://192.168.40.110:8123/api/`

3. **Check Network**
   - Ensure both instances are on the same network
   - Check firewall rules aren't blocking port 8123
   - Verify the IP address is correct

4. **Check Remote HA Configuration**
   - Ensure the remote instance has `http:` configured properly
   - Check if it's using a different port

## Common Causes

- Remote HA instance is down
- Firewall blocking the connection
- Wrong IP address or port
- Network isolation between instances

## This is NOT a Code Issue

The config flow errors have been fixed. This connection error is an infrastructure/network issue that needs to be resolved at the system level.
