# Remote Home Assistant - Complete Fix Summary

## All Issues Fixed (2025-07-30)

### 1. âœ… Config Flow 400 Bad Request Error
**Root Cause**: The options flow was trying to access integration data before it was available.

**Fix**: Added error handling in:
- `async_step_init` - Gracefully handles missing remote connection data
- `_domains_and_entities` - Falls back to configured entities if remote is unavailable

### 2. âœ… Deprecation Warning
**Issue**: Setting `self.config_entry` explicitly in `__init__` is deprecated.

**Fix**: Changed to use `super().__init__(config_entry)` which properly initializes the parent class.

### 3. âœ… Selector Configuration Format
**Issue**: Incorrect selector configuration format for Home Assistant.

**Fix**: Updated `search_selector.py` to return properly formatted selector configs.

### 4. âœ… Discovery Endpoint Fallback
**Issue**: 400 error when remote instance doesn't have the integration.

**Fix**: Implemented fallback discovery using standard HA API endpoints.
